Recommendation

A few techniques to approach a project:

Break it down, then break it down further till you get granular pieces / challenges

Peek into how others approached those individual pieces / challenges: google each piece separately and read through stackoverflow / github / reddit resources you find on that piece

Visualize possible approaches coming together and working together. Put notes together listing the pieces and what they give each other.

When stuck, ask for help! That's what social media is for.
